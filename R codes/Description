Employee survival analysis uses both parametric and nonparametric methodologies to simulate the survival distribution based on available data. 
Parametric approaches estimate survival probability by fitting certain distributions to the data, such as the exponential or Weibull distribution.
Non-parametric approaches, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Cox regression model, are utilized when the underlying distribution is unknown or complex. 
These methods provide useful information about employee tenure and the possibility of attrition over time. 



Classification algorithms are critical in churn prediction since they help discover elements that contribute to attrition.
Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis are prominent methods for categorizing employees as churn or non-churn based on a variety of predictor variables. 
By examining indicators such as job satisfaction, tenure, performance evaluations, and demographic characteristics, these algorithms can accurately anticipate 
employee attrition and identify the most relevant reasons causing churn inside the firm. This allows HR managers to proactively address retention issues and apply tailored 
initiatives to reduce turnover rates
